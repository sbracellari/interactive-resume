          Between my job and my time studying at Oakland, I've worked on a handful of software
          projects. Below I've listed two of them in detail, and the rest I'll mention briefly.

          The first project I'd like to talk about is a project that I wrote with two other students
          in the database design course that I took in the winter 2020 semester at Oakland. It was a
          banking application that we we called SYB Bank (S, Y, and B being our last initials), and
          it had a ReactJS frontend and a RESTful Python backend that was connected to a MySQL
          database. The app mocked administrator view with login, client data modification, and
          transaction approval/denial features. It also mocked a client view with login, bank
          account creation/deletion, and transaction initiation features The project was written
          using Visual Studio Code and Vim, and managed with Git. You can{' '}

          The next project is one that I worked on individually at my job at Oakland University's
          University Technology Services (UTS). I'll talk more about that in the next section. This
          project was called Financial Aid Soffit (a soffit is very similar to a web application),
          and it was originally built for the university's MySAIL website. It had a Java/SpringBoot
          backend, a ReactJS frontend, and was connected to an Oracle database. The Java backend was
          also RESTful and it authenticated using JWEs. This application was written to display
          studentsâ€™ financial aid information in a clean and concise way while still providing
          necessary data. It was written using Visual Studio Code and Vim, and managed with Git. The
          open source version is{' '}
